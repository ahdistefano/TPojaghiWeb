# TPojaghiWeb
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Web application built around Flask.
Latest deployed version: https://tpojaghi.onrender.com/

## Tech

The project uses a number of packages to work properly:
- Flask
- Flask-Babel
- Swiper.js
- Bootstrap 5

## Installation

You'll need [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/) installed on your machine before setting up the project (other 3.x versions might work but haven't been tested).
Once you clone the repo in your machine, step into the directory, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
